## Homebrew tap rig

See more at https://github.com/r-lib/rig

Note that a command line only version of rig is now also available in homebrew-core by name of [r-rig](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/HEAD/Formula/r/r-rig.rb).

```
brew install r-rig
```

However this does not include the menu bar app, only the `rig` utility itself.
